1. Flow From Directory for data augmentation training
2. test image on the fly
3. demo script for imagenet prediction (or anything using a pretrained eznetwork)
4. SMOTING binary classes for imbalance: need an smote_oversampling() function into ezset
5. Add example dataset like MNIST, Bacteria, Methylom, Blob, Skin
6. Implementation of YOLO like architecture
7. Implementation of basic autoencoder (AE)
8. Implementation of convolutional autoencoder (CAE)
9. Implementation of variational autoencoder (VA)
10. Extraction and visualization of network layer weight for convolutional neural networks
11. Function to show segmentation prediction mask on original images (either lasso or color superimposed)
12. Take metric/loss name into learning Graph
13. Replace 0/1/2 .. into the confusion matrix in case we have a synset into the ezset
14. ezblocks : Code blocks again using __call__ to be able to build a network from ezblock using functionnal way as Keras do
15. ResNet50 => revoir le code car changement de version de keras
16. Check overwriting variable into JupyterNotebook -> should conflict transformers ....
17. Manage Tensorflow Graph Session (check pw2_cnn.ipynb on Colab to get the piece of code to clear keras session)


18. Make ezutils.keep without synsets

URGENT
1. Go through ezmodel.learning_graph() to exclude "lr" from history ("ReduceLROnplateau"), display graph with
correct title (loss & metrics name) instead of loss graph metrics graph ...
