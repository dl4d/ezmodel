### You have just found Ezmodel.

Ezmodel is a high-level Deep Learning model generation library. Written in Python and capable of running on top of [Keras](https:/github.com/keras-team/keras/). It facilitates data loading and preprocessing, keras model construction and training, model monitoring and evaluation.

Just give to Ezmodel :
- Path to your Dataset:
- Model type (classification, regression, segmentation, autoencoder)
- A Keras neural network

 ... and that's it !

Use Ezmodel if you need to easily develop Deep learning models without strong programming skills.

Read the documentation  ad [ezmodel.io] (https://ezmodel.io)

Ezmodel is compatible with : Python 3.6+
